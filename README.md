📱Google Play App Category Prediction📱
        

This machine learning project predicts the category (genre) of apps on the Google Play Store based on various features such as ratings, reviews, installs, size, and price. The aim is to help developers and businesses understand how different attributes influence an app’s classification and discoverability.

🧾 Introduction:

With the exponential growth of mobile applications, organizing and classifying apps efficiently on platforms like the Google Play Store has become crucial for improving user experience and app discoverability. Misclassified or poorly labeled apps often get buried under irrelevant search results.

This project focuses on using machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that can classify an app into its appropriate category/genre based on its metadata. Leveraging the Google Play Store dataset, we aim to understand how features such as app ratings, number of installs, size, and price contribute to accurate genre prediction.

📌 Project Overview:

Objective: Build a classification model to predict the genre/category of an Android app.

Dataset: Google Play Store dataset from Kaggle

Problem Type: Multi-class classification

ML Models Used: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN

🧰 Technologies Used:

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn


📊 Key Features Used:

App Name

Category
